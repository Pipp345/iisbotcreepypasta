# **iis stupid cone**  
*A Creepypasta*

---

If you ever see a **big traffic cone** outside your house...  
**RUN.**

It doesn’t matter what time it is.  
It doesn’t matter if you're tired, or curious, or brave.  
**Just run.**

This isn’t a regular cone.  
This is *"iis stupid cone."*  
And it's **coning** for you.

### The Origin

Nobody really knows how it started.  
Some say it used to be a *normal* traffic cone.  
Bright orange. Reflective. Harmless.

Until one day…  
**iidk** — some say it was a hacker, others say it was a madman —  
found it and decided to **inject a DLL into it.**

Yes.  
**A DLL.**

Code meant for machines, for control, for intelligence.  
But cones aren’t meant to *think*.  
And yet...  
This one did.

The injection brought it to life.  
But something went wrong.  
Or maybe it went **exactly as planned.**

### The Entity

Once the code took hold, the cone changed.  
It started **moving on its own**.  
Sliding across asphalt.  
Whispering in static.  
It didn't have a face, but you could feel it *watching.*

And then it started to **cone.**

People.  
Pets.  
Even other cones.

It waits outside your house.  
Not moving. Just… waiting.

Until you look away.  
Until you blink.  
Until you sleep.

Then it climbs your steps.  
And when you least expect it...  
**It cones you.**

It forces itself over your head.  
Tighter…  
Tighter…  
Until you can’t breathe.

Until everything fades into orange and silence.

**iis stupid cone is real.**  
And now that you’ve read this…  
It knows your IP.

Don’t look outside.  
Don’t check the street.  
Don’t open the door if you hear dragging plastic.

Because once it’s there…

**It’s already too late.**
